# ReactJs-KPR Project Setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and update the ReactJs-KPR project repository and start a new feature branch.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Git and Node.js installed on your machine.

## Setup Instructions

1. Initialize the repository by running `git init`.

2. Add the remote origin by running `git remote add origin https://github.com/NelsenJ/ReactJs-KPR.git`

3. Switch to the main branch by running `git checkout -b main`.

4. Pull the latest code from the main branch by running `git pull origin main`.

5. Check for outdated packages by running `npm outdated`. This will check if any packages in `package.json` are outdated.

6. Install all dependencies for the project by running `npm install`.

## Creating a New Feature Branch

1. Create and switch to a new branch by running `git checkout -b newBranch`, replacing `newBranch` with the name of your new branch (e.g., `feature-login`, `bugfix-header`).

2. Push the new branch to the remote by running `git push origin newBranch`.

With this guide, you should have your project set up and ready for development.

### Additional Tips

To keep your branch up-to-date with the main branch, regularly pull changes from main. Use descriptive names for branches, such as `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`.
